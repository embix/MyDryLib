MyDryLib
========

I don't want to repeat myself. I'm usally lazy. 
So if I notice to have written some piece of code twice
in a likely way it seems of futher use. I'll just dump it here.
Whenever it may be usefull again, I'll invest some time in
cleanup/refactoring to make it more evolvable.
Thus I should end up with a lot of usefull, loosly coupled code for every common case.

Warning
-------

As changes towards a better structured framework are intended, breaking changes are inevitable
and you shouldn't expect any legacy support.
